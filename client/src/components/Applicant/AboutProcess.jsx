          The Ethical Research Clearance system is designed to ensure that all
          research conducted within our medical faculty adheres to the highest
          ethical standards. This system provides a streamlined and transparent
          process for researchers to submit their proposals for review,
          ensuring that research involving human participants, animals, or
          sensitive data is conducted responsibly and ethically. Through this
          platform, faculty members and researchers can easily submit their
          research protocols, track the progress of their applications, and
          receive approvals or feedback from the ethics review board. Our goal
          is to foster research that prioritizes the safety, privacy, and
          well-being of participants while maintaining scientific integrity and
          compliance with regulatory standards.
